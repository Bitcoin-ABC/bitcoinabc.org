      <h2>What happened ?</h2>
      <p>The planned upgrade of the eCash network has successfully been completed. The first post-upgrade block is block number <a href="https://explorer.e.cash/block/000000000000000003e79cfe757a675909fd2bffde52158ce4ec826e5ac6ae79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">818670</a>.</p>
      <h2>Who needs to upgrade?</h2>
      <p>All operators of a Bitcoin ABC full node must upgrade to the latest major version ({{ latestVersion }}). This includes node operators, Avalanche staking nodes, Miners and Exchanges. The up-to-date node version is available at our <a href="/releases/">Releases</a> page.</p>
      <h2>What features are included in the Network Upgrade?</h2>
      <h3>Staking Rewards</h3>
      <p>A block policy is added that 10% of the block reward is allocated as a staking reward. There is one recipient in each block, chosen from the avalanche quorum. The reward is sent to the Proof `payoutAddress` field, chosen deterministically from the quorum based on the previous block hash, with probability weighted by the Proof's stake amount.</p>
      <h3>Miner fund increase</h3>
      <p>The miner fund, part of the block reward that is funding eCash network development, was increased from 8% of the block reward to 32%.</p>
      <p>eCash miners must ensure that their mining setup is properly configured to use the proper miner fund amount. This information is available via the `getblocktemplate` RPC.</p>
      <h2>How do I upgrade?</h2>

      <p>The process of upgrading your node is straightforward: simply stop the currently running node, download the new version, and start the new version. Here are some example instructions for upgrading from version 0.27.15 to the {% if latestVersion == site.data.github-releases[0].name %}latest{% else %}upcoming{% endif %} version ({{ latestVersion }}) on Linux:
        <ul>
          <li>Shut down the node: <code>./bitcoin-abc-0.27.15/bin/bitcoin-cli stop</code></li>
          <li>Download the new version archive from the website: <code>wget https://download.bitcoinabc.org/{{ latestVersion }}/linux/bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
          <li>Extract the archive: <code>tar xzf bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
          <li>Restart the node with the new version: <code>./bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}/bin/bitcoind -daemon</code></li>
          <li>Clean up old version and archives (optional):
            <ul>
              <li><code>rm -rf bitcoin-abc-0.27.15</code></li>
              <li><code>rm -f bitcoin-abc-0.27.15-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
              <li><code>rm -f bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Do I need to upgrade my wallet?</h2>
      <p>The network upgrade only affects full nodes. Other eCash software, including wallets such as <a href="/electrum/">Electrum ABC</a> are not affected by the network upgrade.</p>

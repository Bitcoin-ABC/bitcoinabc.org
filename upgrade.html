      <h2>What happened?</h2>
      <p>The planned upgrade of the eCash network has successfully been completed. The first post-upgrade block is block number <a href="https://explorer.e.cash/block-height/792117">792117</a>.</p>
      <h2>Who needs to upgrade?</h2>
      <p>All operators of a Bitcoin ABC full node should have upgraded to the latest major version (0.27.x). This includes Avalanche staking nodes, Miners and Exchanges. The up-to-date node version is available at our <a href="/releases/">Releases</a> page.</p>
      <h2>I forgot to upgrade, what should I do?</h2>
      <p>If you forgot to upgrade and had an old node version running through the upgrade, your node may have marked the upgraded chain as invalid. In order to fix this problem, simply upgrade to Bitcoin ABC version 0.27.5 or greater,  available at our <a href="/releases/">Releases page</a>.
This version includes a checkpoint that will cause the node to reconsider the upgrade block, and get back onto the correct chain tip.</p>
      <h2>What features are included in the Network Upgrade?</h2>
      <h3>Consensus-enforced transaction version</h3>
      <p>The version field of eCash transactions is now restricted to versions 1 or 2 by the consensus rules. This means that blocks containing a transaction with a different version number can no longer be mined. The purpose of this change is to pave the way for future implementation of a new transaction format. It will allow the new transaction format to use a version number that has never been used before in the eCash blockchain. This rule was previously enforced by policy, so no wallet update is required.</p>
      <h3>Miner fund moved out of consensus rules</h3>
      <p>The miner fund, part of the block reward that is funding eCash network development, is no longer be enforced by consensus. It is now enforced by policy, and a block that contains an invalid or no miner fund output will be rejected by Avalanche Post-Consensus. This makes it easier to update the miner fund parameters such as the acceptable addresses.</p>
      <h3>Removed chained transactions limits</h3>
      <p>With the upgrade activated, Bitcoin ABC nodes now accept an unlimited number of chained transactions in the mempool. This was limited to 50 transactions before the upgrade. Note that this is a policy change and has no impact on the consensus rules.</p>
      <h2>How do I upgrade?</h2>
      {% assign latestVersion = site.data.github-releases[0].name %}
      <p>The process of upgrading your node is straightforward: simply stop the currently running node, download the new version, and start the new version. Here are some example instructions for upgrading from version 0.26.13 to the latest version ({{ latestVersion }}) on Linux:
        <ul>
          <li>Shut down the node: <code>./bitcoin-abc-0.26.13/bin/bitcoin-cli stop</code></li>
          <li>Download the new version archive from the website: <code>wget https://download.bitcoinabc.org/{{ latestVersion }}/linux/bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
          <li>Extract the archive: <code>tar xzf bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
          <li>Restart the node with the new version: <code>./bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}/bin/bitcoind -daemon</code></li>
          <li>Clean up old version and archives (optional):
            <ul>
              <li><code>rm -rf bitcoin-abc-0.26.13</code></li>
              <li><code>rm -f bitcoin-abc-0.26.13-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
              <li><code>rm -f bitcoin-abc-{{ latestVersion }}-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Do I need to upgrade my wallet?</h2>
      <p>The network upgrade only affects full nodes. Other eCash software, including wallets such as <a href="/electrum/">Electrum ABC</a> are not affected by the network upgrade.</p>

Bitcoin ABC, the preeminent Bitcoin Cash $BCH protocol development and devops team, is launching its 2020 fundraiser at [https://fund.bitcoinabc.org](https://fund.bitcoinabc.org).

The team is focused on scaling Bitcoin Cash to serve billions of daily users as "censorship-resistant peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world."

Bitcoin ABC aims to raise USD$3.3 million, or about 14,500 BCH, to fund its operations through the end of April 2021. The team is offering several methods of funding, including: individual, small business and corporate sponsorships; funding buckets for specific development projects; and direct donations.

"Bitcoin ABC has proven to be a team capable of delivering software that‘s fulfilling enterprise-level standards," said Tobias Ruck, CEO of Bitcoin Cash startup be.cash UG.

The development team has released a 26-page business plan with a detailed budget and a timeline of deliverables that the public can download from [https://fund.bitcoinabc.org](https://fund.bitcoinabc.org).

The team has already made significant progress towards its fundraising goals over the last 5 weeks through an outreach initiative to Bitcoin Cash companies that is led by recent hire and Business Development Manager George Donnelly.

Bitcoin ABC is the Bitcoin Cash full node software development team led by Amaury Séchet, who was responsible for the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork from Bitcoin Core $BTC. Séchet has led ABC since then, taking primary responsibility for maintaining and securing the Bitcoin Cash network.

"Bitcoin ABC has produced consistent work despite continual obstacles," said Chris Troutner, Founder of the Permissionless Software Foundation.

Bitcoin ABC will also participate in the first Flipstarter.cash full node fundraiser alongside other Bitcoin Cash full node software projects. Flipstarter is a new and innovative assurance-contract-based funding mechanism on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

“With the financial crisis looming, the importance of digital cash will become more critical than ever before. Bitcoin Cash has the best chances to make this a reality, and the window of opportunity is now. However, Bitcoin Cash’s infrastructure has been underfunded, which has led to brain drain and long standing issues left unaddressed. If the situation doesn’t change, then Bitcoin Cash might see a once-in-a-decade opportunity pass by without seizing it,” said Bitcoin ABC Lead Developer Amaury Séchet.

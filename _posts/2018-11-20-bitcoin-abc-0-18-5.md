We are pleased to announce that Bitcoin ABC 0.18.5 has been released. You can download it at:
[https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.18.5/](https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.18.5/).

We are happy to inform you that the Bitcoin Cash network has been very stable since the upgrade on November 15th.
We continue to work on keeping usersâ€™ funds secure and the network and currency fully functional.

You may have read on different media there are a few miners that continue to threaten the BCH network with chain reorganizations.
Many see this as a threat to the fundamental functionality of the chain and its use as peer to peer cash.
We understand the uncertainty this causes for users, businesses, and the market in general.

With this new release, you will know that transactions are immutable after 10 confirmations.
This protection keeps deep reorganizations from negatively impacting you or your business.

The community has come together stronger than before the protocol upgrade,
and we hope to continue to foster this collaborative environment as we work together
to make Bitcoin Cash the best money the world has ever seen.

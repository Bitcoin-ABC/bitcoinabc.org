The goal of Bitcoin ABC is to help create sound money that is usable by everyone in the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will dramatically increase human freedom and prosperity.

Our role in furthering this goal is to produce high-quality software that serves the needs of the community of users, miners, and merchants. We strive for continuous technical improvement, to produce a reliable product that will provide a solid foundation for Bitcoin Cash. As part of our plan for continuous improvement, we're keeping in line with our [November Upgrade Timeline](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2018-07-05-nov-hardfork-timeline/).

The Bitcoin ABC release version 0.18.0 is now available. You can download it at: [https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.18.0/](https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.18.0/). This release implements all consensus-related changes according to the [November Hardfork Specification](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/94/files).

**REMINDER:** Bitcoin Cash will be undergoing a network protocol upgrade on November 15th. All node operators are required to upgrade in order to remain compatible with the Bitcoin Cash network.

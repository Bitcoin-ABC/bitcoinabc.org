Bitcoin ABC takes security very seriously.  We greatly appreciate any and all disclosures of bugs and vulnerabilities that are done in a responsible manner.  We will engage responsible disclosures according to this policy and put forth our best effort to fix disclosed vulnerabilities as well as reaching out to numerous node operators to deploy fixes in a timely manner.

An up-to-date version of the Responsible Disclosure Policy is maintained within the Bitcoin ABC source code respository, and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/master/DISCLOSURE_POLICY.md).

# Rebrand Announcement

You’re invited to the next era of sound money for the world.

Don’t miss [e.cash](https://e.cash/) on July 1, 2021 at 12 noon UTC.

Derived from one of the most trusted names in the cryptocurrency space, what was once known as BCHA is now eCash.
Here’s some of what’s happening:

* On July 1st, 2021 at 12:00 noon, Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) will rebrand to eCash (XEC).
* The primary unit will be bits (2 decimal places) instead of BCHA (8 decimal places, the legacy default used by both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash).
  * 1 BCHA = 1,000,000 XEC
* The address format will change the prefix from “bitcoincash:” to “ecash:”.
* A new website will be launched at [e.cash](https://e.cash/).
* And a special premiere at launch… Watch the countdown live at [e.cash](https://e.cash/) to see it!

## The eCash Mission

eCash is the natural continuation of the Bitcoin Cash project. Realizing the vision of the legendary Milton Friedman, eCash follows through on key promises such as the innovative Avalanche consensus layer while also introducing concepts never before seen in a Bitcoin project such as staking, fork-free network upgrades, and subchains.

Look for the ticker symbol XEC on exchanges, wallets, or price charts, and take your first step towards true financial freedom.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Question:** Do I need to perform a token swap?
<br>
**Answer:** No. The rebranding from BCHA to eCash (XEC) is not a token swap. There are no changes to the blockchain. The rebrand simply changes how things are displayed to users in wallets and exchanges.


**Question:** What will happen to the BCHA token?
<br>
**Answer:** Nothing changes on the blockchain. Under the hood, “eCash” (XEC) is the same thing as “BCHA”. The way it is displayed to users simply changes. So nothing happens to BCHA token, it just changes name to eCash/XEC, and changes the default base unit so that 1,000,000 XEC = 1 BCHA.


**Question:** What will happen if I send BCHA to an eCash wallet?
<br>
**Answer:** If you send 1 BCHA to an eCash wallet, you will be credited 1,000,000 XEC. The conversion happens in the wallet, there is no change in the transaction format on the blockchain. Similarly, sending 1,000,000 XEC to a BCHA wallet will credit 1 BCHA on the receiving end.


**Question:** Will there be a separate chain?
<br>
**Answer:** No, there is no separate chain. It is the same blockchain as before the rebrand. Just the way it is displayed to users changes.

**Question:** As a BCHA holder, what do I need to do for this rebranding?
<br>
**Answer:** BCHA holders don’t need to do anything. Even if you do nothing, the rebrand will take place automatically. When you upgrade to a new wallet after the rebrand, the display will change automatically to show your holdings as eCash instead of BCHA. If you don’t upgrade your wallets, everything will continue to work as it did before. It is recommended to upgrade, as we expect most wallets and exchanges to use eCash/XEC, so it will be less confusing if you upgrade to a wallet that displays as eCash/XEC.
